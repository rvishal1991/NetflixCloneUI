# 🎬 Netflix UI Clone in SwiftUI

A beautifully crafted **Netflix UI Clone** built using **SwiftUI**, designed as a learning project to explore:

- 🌀 Micro-interactions & smooth animations  
- 🖼️ Lazy image loading for better performance  
- 📌 Sticky headers and dynamic UI behavior  
- 💡 Modern SwiftUI layout techniques  

> ✨ This project is focused on replicating key UI features and transitions seen in the Netflix app while experimenting with animation, scroll behavior, and performance optimizations.

## 🧰 Used Third-Party Packages

This project leverages a few third-party libraries to extend SwiftUI capabilities and simplify development:

- [`SDWebImageSwiftUI`](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI.git) – For lazy loading image from web
- [`SwiftfulRouting`](https://github.com/SwiftfulThinking/SwiftfulRouting) – For naviagtion  
- [`SwiftfulUI`](https://github.com/SwiftfulThinking/SwiftfulUI.git) – Some useful available resusable components

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rvishal1991/NetflixCloneUI.git

2. Open the .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace in Xcode.:

3. Build & run on a simulator or device with iOS 15+.
